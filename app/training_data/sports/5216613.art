THERE are no more tomorrow’s for Port City Leagues Magpies.With just five rounds remaining before the Mid North Coast Premier Cricket League finals, the Magpies must win this weekend’s clash with Nulla.Nulla are currently fourth on the ladder, seven points clear of the Magpies.Anything less than a victory for Gordon Scott’s men on Saturday at Oxley Oval will leave them walking a tightrope to the post-season.“We know what we need to do from here on in,” the captain said.“It’s more about doing the simple things correctly; our bowlers need to not bowl so short and the batsmen need to show a bit more application.“We need to value our wicket a bit more.”We need to value our wicket a bit more.Port City Leagues Magpies captain Gordon ScottPort City will be confident of returning to the winner’s circle after registering a nine-wicket victory over Nulla in the last encounter between the two sides.On that occasion Ben Marron (68 not out) led the way as the Magpies chased down 118 in 18 overs.Scott said his side were wary of Nulla opening bowler Nick Clarke who he believes holds the key to victory.“He’s quicker than Badenoch and has the ability to be really lethal,” Scott said.“Someone like him can rip through a batting order, so we need to make sure we see him off.”Blake Larance’s absence been offset by the return of Jake Hawkins at the top of the order.“We’re pretty much back to full strength so there are no more excuses,” Scott said.“We need to build partnerships and have a bit of a regard for our wicket.”Across town at Wayne Richards Park, Macquarie Hotel will look to consolidate their top spot when they clash with Rovers.Macquarie cruised to a 97-run win when the two teams met earlier in the season at Kempsey.Captain Josh Hyde wanted his side to continue to set the standard for the rest of the competition.He attributes a settled top and middle order with the bat as the key to their consistent season.“We’ve worked out roles for everyone which makes it easier when you have a clear head when you go out to bat,” he said.We’re trying to make our home ground a bit of a graveyard and we haven’t lost there in a very long time.Macquarie Hotel captain Josh Hyde“Everyone’s just focused on their own role.”While their last match was washed out at Wingham last weekend, Michael Pelley made a solid contribution as Macquarie scraped to 9-129.“Pell put his hand up last weekend so it’s handy to have someone different do that,” Hyde said.With the middle of the table a logjam, Hyde was confident his side could contribute to that as Rovers battle for a spot in the finals.“We’re trying to make our home ground a bit of a graveyard and we haven’t lost there in a very long time,” he said.Sam Dwyer will come into the side with Ricky Arnell ruled out.“Sam has been one of our form bowlers, so we won’t lose much with him coming in,” Hyde said.facebookSHAREtwitterTWEETemailwhatsappcommentComments
