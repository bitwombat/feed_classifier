NEW South Wales Police Rugby League Association president Stephen McDonald has forecast three days of top-quality action in Port Macquarie from Tuesday.The best players from around the state will compete for their region as the NSW Police Bank Cup returns to the Hastings for the first time in five years.Usually on the front line protecting communities, most of the boys in blue will be on the front line defensively aiming to claim to be the best region in New South Wales.“The competition has been going for around 40 years and has only been held in Port Macquarie,” McDonald said.“We used to play a weekly competition in Sydney for many years until it died off so we then tried the carnival format.”The carnival format lasted from 2010 until 2013 before the competition returned to being a weekly event, but now the carnival returns once again with eight regions to fight it out.We used to play a weekly competition in Sydney for many years until it died off so we then tried the carnival format.Stephen McDonaldThe Hastings is expected to be represented in the Country North side while the Parramatta Eels and Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles are expected to be the ones to beat.But don’t forget about the Country North Kangaroos, Country South Steelers, Bankstown Giants, Eastern Suburbs Wombats, Macarthur Bulls or Penrith Panthers.“A lot of blokes have work commitments during the week so the decision to take it to Port Macquarie means they are far enough away where they can’t get called in,” McDonald said.“The best part about the carnival is that it’s played during the week which means players can return to their clubs and play of a weekend.McDonald said the reason for hosting the tournament in Port Macquarie was due to the region’s facilities.“The accommodation is second to none and the ground is as well; it ticks a lot of the boxes,” he said.“We have never played it anywhere else.”A lot of blokes have work commitments during the week so the decision to take it to Port Macquarie means they are far enough away where they can’t get called in.Stephen McDonaldMcDonald said strong performances from Tuesday until Friday could result in selection for representative teams throughout the year.“We usually have a City-Country match later in the year and will also have to pick an Australian side,” he said.“There are quite a few handy players who run around and we know there will be a lot of bruises.”Matches consist of 20 minute halves and will kick off at 3pm, 4pm, 5pm and 6pm at Regional Stadium.“Entry is free and everyone is welcome to come and have a look,” McDonald said.facebookSHAREtwitterTWEETemailwhatsappcommentComments
