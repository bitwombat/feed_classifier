PORT Pirates captain Gary Humphreys admits it has been a challenging season for his young chargers.Pirates will play their penultimate round game of the Mid North Coast Premier Cricket League on Saturday when they host Rovers.The match at Wayne Richards Park perhaps provides their best opportunity to register that elusive first victory.“Morale is still pretty high and all the boys are enjoying playing,” Humphreys said.“It hasn’t been a problem playing games and everyone is still having fun.”Given Rovers currently sit just one rung above Pirates on the ladder, Humphreys was confident of a strong performance.“It’s probably our grand final this weekend if you want to look at it like that,” he said.“But we do have four out this weekend.”Paul Stait, David Firkin, Mark Vandoros and Alex Horder will all step up from second grade to fill the void in the Premier League side.“We’re lucky in that we’ll get some experienced players coming to help us due to second grade having the bye,” Humphreys said.The focus would be on working in partnerships, particularly with the bat.“That’s been a bit of a problem of ours throughout the year so that will be a big thing for me this weekend,” Humphreys said.facebookSHAREtwitterTWEETemailwhatsappcommentComments
