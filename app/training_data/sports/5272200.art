 Four: Jack Connolly drives down the ground last weekend.PORT Pirates captain Gary Humphreys is looking forward to having one more crack this season.Their challenging 2017-2018 Mid North Coast Premier Cricket League campaign comes to a close at Wayne Richards Park on Saturday.Humphreys knows they have their backs to the wall as Taree West aim to jump into the top four and finals contention.“I don’t think anyone will be saying thank goodness the season is finally over,” he said.“The results for us haven’t been as successful as we’d like, but it’s given us the opportunity to blood young kids which is great.“Players like Connor Cook wouldn’t be playing Australian under-16s if he wasn’t playing in the Premier League this season.”The Pirates skipper said their cause hadn’t been helped throughout the season with the constant chopping and changing of the side.“I don’t think we’ve fielded the same side two weeks in a row which makes things really difficult,” he said.Cameron Ashe, Adam Carrall, Jamie Carroll and Ben Woodward have all played limited matches.It has meant the young brigade of Jared and Ambrose Humphreys, Cook and Tom Connolly haven’t had the consistency around them.“That’s been the problem for us all year,” Humphreys said.“When you lose five or six players throughout the season it makes it tough.”facebookSHAREtwitterTWEETemailwhatsappcommentComments
