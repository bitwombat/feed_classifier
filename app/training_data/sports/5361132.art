This was followed by a clever kick through at our line to be dived on and the try converted.  The final score was 32 to 12 for the home team.  While credit must be shared by the team, the effort from the bench players in Amos Donovan, Orry Berry, Stan Chatfield, Jamie Donovan and Glen Strong must be credited.  Best defence goes to Jake Flanagan, Ben McMillan and James Bright.  Best attack Ben McMillan.  Off the bench Stan Chatfield and Glen Strong.
