 Runs there: Aaron Hagenbach cuts through point during Wauchope RSL's win over Taree West. Photo: Ivan SajkoWAUCHOPE RSL have a nervous week ahead despite their 77-run win over Taree West on Saturday.After losing the toss and being sent in, captain Matt Day’s men struggled to 6/58 at one stage before Isaac King (36) and Matt Miller (43 not out) rescued the innings.They scrapped their way to 152 before Miller claimed a wicket with the first ball of the run chase to set Taree on their heels.“Isaac King stood up again for us and with Matty’s late-order hitting, we got to a good score,” Day said.“I’ll back our bowlers to defend any total we can set.”Spinner Bailey Smith (5/10 off six overs) cleaned up the tail as Taree slumped to 75 all out in the 27th over.“Bailey bowled really well for us and got the vital wicket of Millsy,” Day said.The captain (3/16 off eight overs) also chipped in along with Aaron Hagenbach (1/15 off five overs) in another strong team performance.“Our last three weeks have been really pleasing," Day said.“We probably don’t have that one outstanding individual, but we work really well together.”Port City Leagues Magpies’ surprising 62-run win over Macquarie Hotel means Wauchope now have to rely on other results to go their way next weekend.“It’s not ideal when that happens and you don’t want to do that, but we’ve done everything we can,” Day said.“I’ll keep by the phone and get updates from some of the other grounds and probably go and cheer on Pirates against Taree next weekend.”facebookSHAREtwitterTWEETemailwhatsappcommentComments
