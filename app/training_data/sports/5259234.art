But a return to Merewether was always on the cards.“I really started enjoying my soccer again when I moved across to Merewether after two years of really hating the game,” she said.“Those girls have been so supportive throughout the whole adventure in Melbourne and I’m excited to work with them all again.”Merewether coach Cassie Koppen expected Dobson’s return to have a positive influence on the squad.“Rhali’s obviously coming off a championship win in the W-League, so she is going to be full of confidence,” Koppen said. “She’s incredibly fit, probably the fittest she’s ever been.”, and she’s coming back to us from a really professional environment.“Hopefully we can all learn something from her from that experience and I think her effort will probably be contagious at training.”facebookSHAREtwitterTWEETemailwhatsappcommentComments
