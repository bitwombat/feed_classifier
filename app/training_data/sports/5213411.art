 D'Arcy Short is hoping to retain his top order role in Australia's next Twenty20 clash.D'Arcy Short blasted into Australia's Twenty20 side on his feats as an opener but he's prepared to slide down the order if the national team sees fit.Short made just four on international debut against New Zealand on Saturday as Australia cantered to a seven-wicket win in the tri-series opener.He opened alongside skipper David Warner with usual top order batsman Aaron Finch sidelined with a hamstring injury.Australia are yet to finalise their XI for Wednesday night's match against England in Hobart.Finch, who hasn't played since Australia's third ODI against England on January 21, is unlikely to pad up but if he does Short is okay with a shift down the order.Short set a new mark for most runs in a BBL season with 572, plundering 246 of those from five matches at Bellerive Oval."I'm still trying to adjust to international cricket but I definitely have confidence in what I've done out here through the last couple of weeks," he said on Tuesday of his return to Tasmania's capital."In any form of cricket you have to be adaptable and have to bat anywhere in the order or even bowl anywhere in the order."Hopefully I'm opening again because I like batting there."It was a whirlwind weekend for Short, who after Saturday's international, flew from Sydney to Adelaide for Sunday's BBL final against the Strikers.His 68 from 44 there wasn't quite enough to get the Hobart Hurricanes across the line.England, meanwhile, have some welcome selection headaches.Alex Hales (hand) and Jason Roy (back spasms) are likely to be fit and at the top of the order but seamer Liam Plunkett (hamstring) is expected to be on ice.Quick Chris Jordan will be available though after overcoming a hamstring niggle.England's sole Twenty20 warm-up was an eight-wicket drubbing of the PM's XI where David Willey took 34 from one Nathan Lyon over in a knock of 79."We have guys who are pressing cases for different positions, they're good decisions to be making," skipper Eoin Morgan said, adding the balance of his side will depend on the pitch.Morgan earned plaudits for his aggressive captaincy in England's 4-1 ODI series win over Australia and plans to again throw caution into the wind."It's a difficult balance. It's about playing it as you see it when you're out there, taking a reasonable gamble when you think it's worth it," he said.facebookSHAREtwitterTWEETemailwhatsapp
