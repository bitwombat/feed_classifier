They also had an opportunity to blow out a few off-season cobwebs.Henry said players admitted they “got through the day easier than they did last year.”“That means that our conditioning programs are working because the blokes that are the regular trainers weren’t exhausted by the end of the game,” he said.“It was a good day out and while we didn’t win any of our games, all the boys put their hands up and did some good things.“We saw glimpses of how we want to play.”The performances of Lachlan Ross and Kye Alpen also provided encouraging signs for the season ahead.“It was good for them to have the opportunity to run the show without the Adam McCormack’s being out there with them,” Henry said.Wauchope and Kempsey impressed the coach the most in the shortened form of the game and he believes the Thunder in particular will be much improved on last season.“Early indications are that Wauchope will be much stronger this season which is great for our competition,” Henry said.“We’re preparing for a long season ahead, but you don’t win too much in February.”The Vikings have pencilled in a three-way trial at Lake Cathie against Hunters Hill and Walcha on March 10, before they head to Inverell in late March.facebookSHAREtwitterTWEETemailwhatsappcommentComments
