Photo: Paul JobberPORT City Breakers stalwart Jazzy Wilbow will lead a strong Group 3 league tag representative team into battle with Group 2 at Wingham on April 21.Wilbow will co-captain the side, having missed the corresponding encounter last year and will have fond memories of the last time she was on the rep scene.On that occasion two years ago, the East Coast Dolphins had numerous Group 3 representatives when they won the Country Championships.The Breakers dominate the side with six players helping to make up the squad of 17.Wilbow will have plenty of familiar faces alongside her with Larissa Ward, Brittany Mackay, Di Lawrence, Georgia Williams and Nikita Binge also selected in the team.“It’s actually an advantage for myself because we all know how we play and we all get along like sisters,” Wilbow said.“Having them in the side makes me feel at ease and probably makes them feel at ease playing as well.”Wilbow said it was an honour to be selected as co-captain alongside Wauchope’s Natalie Hurrell.“It makes me feel good because it’s a comeback form last year,” she said.“I was injured for the majority of last season and only came back in the last six weeks so it means a lot.“I’ve been playing since I was 15 years old so to be a captain of a rep side is pretty good.”As Wilbow closes in on 150 games for the Breakers in the Group 3 league tag competition, she said she was looking forward to further success on the representative stage.“We won the grand final for the Dolphins in the first-ever year we had a rep side go away,” she said.While the Group 3 team looked strong on paper, the co-captain remained wary of their Group 2 opponents.“Group 2 have a couple of players who are nippy and fast around the ruck, but I think one of their best players – Sharon McGrady – has recently moved to Sydney to play for South Sydney in the girls rugby league competition,” Wilbow said.“She’ll be a loss for them.”facebookSHAREtwitterTWEETemailwhatsappcommentComments
