Photo: Paul JobberEASTERN Suburbs Wombats and Penrith Panthers appear to be on course to face off in the NSW Police Bank Cup state championship final.The Wombats and Panthers finished in the top two of Pool A while Country South and Parramatta finished top two in Pool B.Day three action was cancelled due to torrential rain and a near-flooded Regional Stadium playing surface on Thursday.As a result, the Panthers will take on Parramatta Eels in the first semi-final from 10am on Friday before the Roosters face the Country South Steelers at 11am.NSW Police Rugby League Association president Stephen McDonald said it had been an exciting two days worth of rugby league before the heavens opened up.“The ground is our main worry at the moment,” he said.“We had one bloke who drove 14 hours from Bourke, so we’re ringing around trying to get a suitable venue for Friday.“We have to finish the competition somehow.”Local hopes the Country North Kangaroos won’t appear on the final day, but were involved in one of the matches of the carnival in driving rain on Wednesday night.The Kangaroos snuck home 15-14 with a field goal after the siren.Some of the action has been willing throughout the carnival with no team willing to take a backward step.“Some of the boys work with each other, but when they pull on that jersey they’re playing for their region,” McDonald said.The final will be played on Friday night from 5pm.facebookSHAREtwitterTWEETemailwhatsappcommentComments
