Who thought it was a good idea?Hastings cricket identities have weighed in, including Macquarie Hotel captain Josh Hyde.He feels calls for Australian captain Steve Smith to never play another match in the Baggy Green are too extreme.“Steve Smith has done a lot of damage to his reputation and everyone makes an error, but he should be playing cricket for Australia,” Hyde said.“I’m a big fan of his, but he shouldn’t be captain.”Hyde compared what the Australians did to South African batsman Faf du Plessis’ efforts in 2016.Du Plessis was found guilty of shining the ball using a mint to help it swing, but Hyde remained mystified why the Australians felt the need to attempt to tamper with the ball.“I don’t know why they felt they had to do it when they have the best bowling attack in world cricket; let them do the talking,” Hyde said.“The umpires didn’t change the ball, so whatever they were doing didn’t really work.”The Macquarie captain admitted Smith’s reputation would take some repairing.“A lot of young kids look up to him and I don’t think they’ll stop supporting him because of this one incident,” he said.“But it is his team and his shoulders so the blame rests with him.”The umpires didn’t change the ball, so whatever they were doing didn’t really work.Josh HydeFootage is now circulating involving the Australians trying to tamper with the ball during the fifth Ashes test.Cameron Bancroft can be seen putting what appears to be sugar in his left pocket.Wauchope RSL captain Matt Day said it was largely due to a focus on results in modern sport.“There’s a lot of focus on that these days,” he said.“But then questions start to rise about how long has it been going on for and it starts to taint results from the time Smith took over from Michael Clarke.”Day agreed that Smith should relinquish the captaincy, but it should not end his career.“He made an error of judgment even though it’s not something minor so he probably has to earn his spot again,” he said.“I think it’s going to get a lot worse before it gets better.”facebookSHAREtwitterTWEETemailwhatsappcommentComments
