The North Coast Public Health Unit is reminding residents to protect themselves against mosquitoes after cases of Ross River and Barmah Forest virus infections in the region double those recorded for the same period last year. Public Health Director Paul Corben said recent warm weather had been favourable to mosquito breeding late in the season with the viruses detected in mosquitoes trapped at several locations across the NSW North Coast. "Ross River and Barmah Forest viruses can be common in the region and are transmitted by infected mosquitoes that breed in flooded, grassy and swampy areas and around waterways," he said. "This year, 113 residents have been diagnosed with Ross River virus and 32 with Barmah Forest virus in the region which stretches from Laurieton to the Queensland border. Of these cases, 89 have been reported in the past four weeks - approximately double those for the same period in 2019." Symptoms include tiredness, rash, fever, and sore and swollen joints. These usually resolve after several days but some may be experienced for weeks or even months. Mr Corben advised residents to protect against mosquitoes until cooler weather brings an end to the breeding season. "While most people at home due to current movement restrictions, many are heading outdoors early or late in the day to get some exercise and this is when mosquitoes are very active so take extra care when out and about," he said.
