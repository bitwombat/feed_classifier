 Inspection: TOMRA Cleanaway will inspect the reverse vending machine for drainage issues while recycling bins are about to be installed at the site.The business responsible for the maintenance of a reverse vending machine on the corner of Bay and Park streets says it will inspect the site for drainage issues.A TOMRA Cleanaway spokesperson was responding to concerns raised by Port Macquarie resident Shayne Phipps.Mr Phipps said he had concerns about a number of issues relating to the positioning and maintenance of the RVM.“I understand it is currently emptied twice a day. As the scheme becomes more popular, and more people use it, there will be a need for the truck to come more regularly,” he said.“While there is also nowhere to wash your hands, there does not appear to be a drain to feed water away from the kiosk. There is water, which smells like it is mixed with the excess of the cans and bottles being deposited that appears to be pooling around the front of the kiosk. And it smells.”The TOMRA Cleanaway spokesperson said the site will be inspection for any potential drainage problems.“The RVM Kiosk is regularly cleaned,” the spokesperson said. “The site was also assessed for accessibility before installation..”The RVM Kiosk is cleaned daily by TOMRA Cleanaway and negotiations are currently underway for recycling bins to be included at the site.”​There are now over 365 collection points up and running across NSW with more to come.For more information on the scheme, a map of collection points and a list of eligible drink containers, visit: www.returnandearn.org.auRelated topic:Bottling a win for recyclingfacebookSHAREtwitterTWEETemailwhatsappcommentComments
