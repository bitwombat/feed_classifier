 UPGRADE COMING: A new pontoon will soon be built at the Rocks Ferry Reserve in Wauchope.Work gets underway on a new floating pontoon at Wauchope’s Rocks Ferry Reserve on Monday, February 12.The pontoon will be placed on the eastern side of the Rocks Ferry bridge.Port Macquarie-Hastings Council says the pontoon will provide better water access for boat launching, improved safety and reduce waiting times.Construction is likely to take about two weeks, weather permitting.During this time the boat ramp will be mostly closed, however, during the course of the project it may be reopened for limited periods where possible. The $120,000 upgrade is the result of the council’s continued focus on improving recreational boating facilities across the region.  The council is contributing $40,000 towards the project and funding of $80,000 is being provided under the NSW Government’s Boating Now Program. Council group manager Liam Bulley said the improvements were prioritised as part of council’s recreation action plan, and were made possible through an ongoing collaboration with Roads and Maritime Services (RMS). “We’ve been working with the RMS over the last two years to assess our region’s recreational boating facilities, and to learn more about what the community would like to see improved. “It’s great that we’re now able to deliver the new floating pontoon at Rocks Ferry Reserve, which is a busy access point to the Hastings River particularly during holiday periods,” Mr Bulley said. Upgrades to the Rocks Ferry boat ramp add to the recent announcement of planned rejuvenation works to two boat ramps in the Camden Haven, and last week’s opening of a new accessible pontoon at McInherney Park in Port Macquarie. “Council thanks local boaties, and the broader community for their cooperation and patience whilst the improvements to the Rocks Ferry Reserve boat ramp take place,” Mr Bulley said.
