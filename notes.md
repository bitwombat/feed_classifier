Main tutorial I used - has visualisations

Pre-req:

For some reason, TfidfTransformer produced all-sports classifications, so I
stayed using the CountVectorizer

(the whole book is online)

"From scratch" Read partially, liked, but realised it would take too much time.

Good terms definition, looks like reasonable tutorial.

Official docs on how to do this:

How to persist the model, after training. I timed this and it was slower for
this small set of training data
